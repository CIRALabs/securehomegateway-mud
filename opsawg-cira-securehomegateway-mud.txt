     MUD processing and extensions for Secure Home Gateway Project
            draft-richardson-opsawg-securehomegateway-mud-00

Abstract

   This document details the mechanism used by the CIRA Secure Home
   Gateway and CIRA MUD integration server to return MUD artifacts to
   participating gateway systems.

   The work in [I-D.ietf-opsawg-mud] creates a relationship between a
   device's manufacturer and a border gateway that may need to enforce
   policy.  This document ads an additional relationship to a service
   provider, trusted by the border gateway to enhance or modify the
   stated security policy.

1.  Introduction

   The initial extension from this document is to provide for a way to
   mark a set of ACLs as being enabled even though the device has
   quaranteed.  {EDNOTE: more motivational text here}

   The second issue addressed by the document is the question of whether
   and when the MUD file should be specific to a specific version of the
   device firmware.

   The third issue is that an intermediary (ISP, or third-party security
   service) may want to extend or amend a MUD file received from a
   manufacturer.  In order to maintain an audit trail of changes, a way
   to encode the previous MUD URL and signature file (and status) is
   provided.

2.  Terminology

   The major new term, compared to the MUD document is the term

   quaranteed:  a device which has shown behaviour forbidden by a MUD
      file ACL, and has subsequently been denied further access to the
      network.

         out-of-date, but still considered sufficiently intact to be
         able to do a firmware update";
